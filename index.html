        <p>
          We've come across the unexpected error on VSC where you need to
          download your main branch (pull) after merging it with a new branch,
          to push it to the git hub repository without any further issues. A
          very fascinating error and one that many new github users will find a
          little confusing. Other related news is that we now have an official
          site, we no longer use the dark web to host our meetings. This comes
          with the added bonus of non-anonymity, less DDOS attacks, and cheese.
